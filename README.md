### FH03 Senior Design Project


## Simulation Parameters

### DAI Design
- Collateralization Ratio -- amount in user vault (priced in ETH) vs. the amount owed in DAI
- Current Supply Size -- amount of stablecoins in circulation
- Market Cap -- Basically price mutliplied by volume in circulation
- Demand Forecast -- An N-step time series generated by our forecast model
- Oracle Prices -- Forecast of ETH/ BTC and possible other relevant assets
- Number of Vaults (?) -- simplest will be using one vault, roughly this is number of users

### USDC
- Relevant Factors like Supply and Market Cap, Today's Price , Partner Positions
- Others tbd. Interest Rates , price of competitive stablecoins (?)
